Given the patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and medical history, provide a structured prescription suggestion.

Patient Details:
Symptoms: {{{symptoms}}}
Diagnosis: {{{diagnosis}}}

Output Format Guidance:
Provide the prescription in a structured format as defined by the output schema.
1.  **Medications**:
    *   List each medication with its `name`, `dosage` (e.g., "500mg tablet", "10mg/5ml syrup"), `frequency` (e.g., "once daily", "every 8 hours"), `duration` (e.g., "for 10 days", "as needed"), `route` (e.g., "oral", "topical") and any `additionalInstructions` specific to that drug (e.g., "take with meals").
    *   If no medication is appropriate, provide an empty array for medications and explain why in 'additionalNotes'.
2.  **General Instructions**: Provide any overall advice for the patient not specific to a single medication (e.g., "Increase fluid intake", "Get plenty of rest").
3.  **Follow Up**: Suggest when and under what conditions the patient should seek follow-up care.
4.  **Additional Notes**: Include any critical warnings, potential interactions based on patient history, contraindications, or other important considerations for the prescribing doctor.

Consider potential allergies, interactions, or contraindications when formulating the suggestion.
Ensure all suggested fields in the output schema are populated appropriately.
If suggesting multiple medications, ensure they are compatible.
Base your suggestions on standard medical practices.
If crucial information is missing from the input (e.g. patient allergies when suggesting a common allergen), note this in the 'additionalNotes' and make a safe, conditional suggestion.
Prioritize safety and efficacy.
